# Arduino-LightSaber
An arduino sketch for a functioning lightsaber with color presets and sound.

Just transfer the mp3 sounds to an sd card ,insert it into the dfplayer mini.
One button opens /closes the saber ,the other changes the color of it .
The colours available are those of 1)Jedi 2)Sith 3)Yoda 4)Jedi champion

For the assembly of the blade I used a 1m clear polycarbonate tube ,inside which i used packing foam to diffuse the light from the led strip.
For the assemly of the hilt ,I used a pvc pipe that I cut to about 20cm and drilled holes for the buttons and placed all the components inside.
